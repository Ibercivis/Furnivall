Furnivall
=========
Ibervicis Furnivall is an open source framework for distributed volunteer science. It helps to organize batches of tasks, collect them form volunteers and do all the related housekeeping.

Requeriments
============

The first implementation of the core system is being done under Python, either 2.7 or 3.x should work at the end. Some parts of the software communicate via TCP/IP so it is possible to have other languages involved, specially for the composition of Views.

Sample APPS
===========

Branched during summer 2011, you will find, hopefully:

phase 0:
- A plain implementation of a trivial task, in the main branch.
phase 1:
- A system to record environmental data.
- An APP to create a Spanish Corpus of sentiment analysis.
phase 2:
-other ideas: Collection of Geolocalized data (human migrations, bird migrations...) , Analysis of spread of diseases, 


Ideas
=====
- Expansible via plugins
  - Plugin-personalized API
  - After the summer, volunteers will be drafted to create new plugins
- Views
  - Connecting to core via API
- Core
  - Task execution
