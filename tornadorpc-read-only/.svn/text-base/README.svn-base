TORNADO-RPC
===========
This library is an implementation of both the JSON-RPC and the
XML-RPC specification (server-side) for the Tornado web framework.
It supports the basic features of both, as well as the MultiCall /
Batch support for both specifications. The JSON-RPC handler supports 
both the original 1.0 specification, as well as the new (proposed) 
2.0 spec, which includes batch submission, keyword arguments, etc.

Installation
============
To install:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

To use this module, you'll need Tornado installed, which you can
get at this address:

http://www.tornadoweb.org/

If you want to use the JSON-RPC handler, you'll also need 
jsonrpclib, which you can grab at:

http://code.google.com/p/jsonrpclib/

This library requires one of the JSON libraries. It looks first 
for cjson, then for the built-in JSON library (with default 
Python 2.6+ distributions), and finally the simplejson library.
